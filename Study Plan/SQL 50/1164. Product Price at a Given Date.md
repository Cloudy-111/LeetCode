# [610. Triangle Judgement](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle-judgement/)

## Description

<p>Table: <code>Products</code></p>

<pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id | int |
| new_price | int |
| change_date | date |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
</pre>

Write a solution to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input:
Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1 | 20 | 2019-08-14 |
| 2 | 50 | 2019-08-14 |
| 1 | 30 | 2019-08-15 |
| 1 | 35 | 2019-08-16 |
| 2 | 65 | 2019-08-17 |
| 3 | 20 | 2019-08-18 |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
Output:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2 | 50 |
| 1 | 35 |
| 3 | 10 |
+------------+-------+
</pre>

### Solutions:

- Approach: get rows with change_date <= '2019-08-16', sort by change_date descending, get the top 1 row. Remaining rows with change_date > '2019-08-16' set price to null

- In first Solution: Each product_id from Products, select FROM Products 1 row has change_date <= '2019-08-16' and same product_id
- Second Solution: Use LEFT JOIN between 2 table: one has distinct product_ids, one has change_date <= '2019-08-16', join on same product_id and max of change_date <= '2019-08-16'
- In Last Solution: Create a CTE for products that have last change date <= '2019-08-16', not include price of it. Left Join Distinct product_id with last change date table on same change_date and left join Products on same change_date and product_id(primary_key)

#### SQL:

```sql
SELECT
    p2.product_id,
    COALESCE(
        (SELECT new_price
        FROM Products AS p1
        WHERE p1.product_id = p2.product_id AND p1.change_date <= '2019-08-16'
        ORDER BY p1.change_date DESC
        LIMIT 1), 10
    ) as price
FROM (SELECT product_id FROM Products GROUP BY product_id) AS p2
```

```sql
SELECT
    p1.product_id,
    COALESCE(p2.new_price, 10) AS price
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM Products
) AS p1
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        new_price,
        change_date
    FROM Products
    WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
) AS p2
ON p1.product_id = p2.product_id
AND p1.change_date = (
    SELECT MAX(change_date)
    FROM Products
    WHERE product_id = p1.product_id AND change_date <= '2019-08-16'
)
```

```sql
WITH Last_change AS(
    SELECT
        product_id,
        MAX(change_date) AS last_change_date
    FROM Products
    WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
    GROUP BY product_id
)
SELECT
    p1.product_id,
    COALESCE(p.new_price, 10) AS price
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM Products) AS p1
LEFT JOIN Last_change AS LC
ON LC.product_id = p1.product_id
LEFT JOIN Products p
ON p.change_date = LC.last_change_date AND
    p.product_id = p1.product_id
```
