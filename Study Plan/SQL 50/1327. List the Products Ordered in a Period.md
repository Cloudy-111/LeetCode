## Description

<p>Table: <code>Products</code></p>

<pre>
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| product_id       | int     |
| product_name     | varchar |
| product_category | varchar |
+------------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains data about the company's products.
</pre>

<p>Table: <code>Orderse</code></p>

<pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| unit          | int     |
+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Products table.
unit is the number of products ordered in order_date.
</pre>

Write a solution to get the names of products that have at least 100 units ordered in February 2020 and their amount.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
Products with product_id = 1 is ordered in February a total of (60 + 70) = 130.
Products with product_id = 2 is ordered in February a total of 80.
Products with product_id = 3 is ordered in February a total of (2 + 3) = 5.
Products with product_id = 4 was not ordered in February 2020.
Products with product_id = 5 is ordered in February a total of (50 + 50) = 100.
</pre>

### Solutions:

- Basic JOIN and GROUP
- In Orders Table, use GROUP BY product_id, filter by WHERE order_date LIKE "2020-02%", calculate SUM(unit)
- Join with Products table ON product_id to take product_name
- Last, use HAVING to check condition SUM(unit) >= 100

#### SQL:

```sql
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(a.unit) AS unit
FROM Orders AS a
LEFT JOIN Products AS p
ON a.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE a.order_date LIKE "2020-02%"
GROUP BY a.product_id
HAVING SUM(a.unit) >= 100
```
