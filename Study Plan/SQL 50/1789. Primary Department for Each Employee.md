# [1789. Primary Department for Each Employee](https://leetcode.com/problems/primary-department-for-each-employee/)

## Description

<p>Table: <code>Employee</code></p>

<pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id | int |
| department_id | int |
| primary_flag | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.
</pre>

Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.

Write a solution to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input:
Employee table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1 | 1 | N |
| 2 | 1 | Y |
| 2 | 2 | N |
| 3 | 3 | N |
| 4 | 2 | N |
| 4 | 3 | Y |
| 4 | 4 | N |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
Output:
+-------------+---------------+
| employee_id | department_id |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 3 |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation:

- The Primary department for employee 1 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 2 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 3 is 3.
- The Primary department for employee 4 is 3.
</pre>

### Solution:

- Cách 1: Gộp 2 bảng: 1 bảng lưu những bản ghi có primary_flag = 'Y' ; bảng 2 gồm những bản ghi có COUNT(employee_id) = 1 và MIN(primary_flag) = 'N' -> dùng UNION
- Cách 2: Sử dụng LEFT JOIN 2 bảng Employee e1 và Employee e2 tại e1.employee_id = e2.employee_id và e2.primary_flag = 'Y'
  sau đó dùng WHERE để lọc ra những bản ghi thỏa mãn nhờ điều kiện: e1.primary_flag = 'Y' hoặc primary_flag tại bảng e1 = 'N' mà bảng 2 không có

#### SQL:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM (
    SELECT employee_id, department_id
    FROM Employee
    WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'

    UNION

    SELECT employee_id, department_id
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY employee_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1 and MIN(primary_flag) = 'N'
) as res
```

```sql
SELECT e1.employee_id, e1.department_id
FROM Employee e1
LEFT JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.employee_id = e2.employee_id AND e2.primary_flag = 'Y'
WHERE e1.primary_flag = 'Y'
    OR (e1.primary_flag = 'N' AND e2.primary_flag is null)
```
