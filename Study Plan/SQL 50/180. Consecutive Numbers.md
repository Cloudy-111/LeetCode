# [180. Consecutive Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers/)

## Description

<p>Table: <code>Logs</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+---------+
| id | int |
| num | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.
</pre>

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input:
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | 2 |
| 5 | 1 |
| 6 | 2 |
| 7 | 2 |
+----+-----+
Output:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1 |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
</pre>

### Solutions:

- Numbers that appear at least three times consecutively mean that number immediately before and after are equal
- So we can use LEAD(for number immediately after) and LAG(for number immediately before) and compare them, then compare with that number
- With first Solution, I use 2 table for LEAD and LAG, JOIN them and use WHERE to filter number that suitable(to make it look easier and similar to the part I drafted)

- In second Solution, I dont use JOIN, just SELECT LEAD and LAG of number and compare them

#### SQL:

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT L1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        num,
        LEAD(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) as lead_num
    FROM Logs
) AS L1

JOIN (
    SELECT
        id,
        num,
        LAG(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) as lag_num
    FROM Logs
) AS L2

ON L1.id = L2.id AND L1.num = L2.num
WHERE (
    L1.lead_num = L2.lag_num AND
    L1.lead_num = L1.num
)

```

```sql
WITH CTE AS(
    SELECT
        id,
        num,
        LEAD(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) as lead_num,
        LAG(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) as lag_num
    FROM Logs
)
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM CTE
WHERE lead_num = lag_num AND lead_num = num
```
