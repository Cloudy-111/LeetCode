# [176. Second Highest Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/)

## Description

<p>Table: <code>Employee</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
</pre>

Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
</pre>

### Solutions:

- Use DENSE_RANK() to mount rank of each distinct salary, then SELECT rank = 2

#### SQL:

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS r_ank
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT (SELECT salary FROM CTE WHERE r_ank = 2 LIMIT 1) AS SecondHighestSalary

```
