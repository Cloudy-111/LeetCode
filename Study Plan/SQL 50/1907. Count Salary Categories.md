# [1907. Count Salary Categories](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-salary-categories/)

## Description

<p>Table: <code>Accounts</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
</pre>

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input: 
Accounts table:
+------------+--------+
| account_id | income |
+------------+--------+
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |
+------------+--------+
Output: 
+----------------+----------------+
| category       | accounts_count |
+----------------+----------------+
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |
+----------------+----------------+
Explanation: 
Low Salary: Account 2.
Average Salary: No accounts.
High Salary: Accounts 3, 6, and 8.
</pre>

### Solution:

- Because we dont have table storage 3 types of Salary, so we Create a CTE include those.
- Category CTE LEFT JOIN with count table
- Count table use CASE WHEN in SELECT, COUNT and GROUP BY income

#### SQL:

```sql
WITH Category AS(
    SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category
    UNION
    SELECT 'Average Salary'
    UNION
    SELECT 'High Salary'
)
SELECT c.category, COALESCE(a.account_count, 0) AS accounts_count
FROM Category AS c
LEFT JOIN(
    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN income > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
            WHEN income >= 20000 THEN 'Average Salary' ELSE
            'Low Salary' END AS category,
        COUNT(income) AS account_count
    FROM Accounts
    GROUP BY category
) AS a
ON a.category = c.category
```
