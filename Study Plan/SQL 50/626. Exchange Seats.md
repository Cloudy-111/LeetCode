# [1978. Employees Whose Manager Left the Company](https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-whose-manager-left-the-company/)

## Description

<p>Table: <code>Seat</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+---------+
| id | int |
| student | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
The ID sequence always starts from 1 and increments continuously.
</pre>

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input:
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1 | Abbot |
| 2 | Doris |
| 3 | Emerson |
| 4 | Green |
| 5 | Jeames |
+----+---------+
Output:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1 | Doris |
| 2 | Abbot |
| 3 | Green |
| 4 | Emerson |
| 5 | Jeames |
+----+---------+
Explanation:
Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.
</pre>

### Solutions:

- Main idea in here is change id of each student: if id is even, select id - 1
- id id is odd, check if id + 1 in list id exist, select id + 1 else remain id
- Last, sort by id

#### SQL:

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 0 THEN id - 1
        WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 1 AND id + 1 NOT IN(SELECT id FROM Seat) THEN id ELSE
        id + 1 END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id
```
