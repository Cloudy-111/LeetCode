# [185. Department Top Three Salaries](https://leetcode.com/problems/department-top-three-salaries/)

## Description

<p>Table: <code>Employee</code></p>

<pre>
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
departmentId is a foreign key (reference column) of the ID from the Department table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.

<p>Table: <code>Department</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+---------+
| id | int |
| name | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.
</pre>

A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input:
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1 | Joe | 85000 | 1 |
| 2 | Henry | 80000 | 2 |
| 3 | Sam | 60000 | 2 |
| 4 | Max | 90000 | 1 |
| 5 | Janet | 69000 | 1 |
| 6 | Randy | 85000 | 1 |
| 7 | Will | 70000 | 1 |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name |
+----+-------+
| 1 | IT |
| 2 | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output:
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT | Max | 90000 |
| IT | Joe | 85000 |
| IT | Randy | 85000 |
| IT | Will | 70000 |
| Sales | Henry | 80000 |
| Sales | Sam | 60000 |
+------------+----------+--------+
</pre>

Explanation:
In the IT department:

- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:

- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees

Constraints:

There are no employees with the exact same name, salary and department.

### Solutions:

- Create a CTE to store salary, departmentId and RANK of each DISTINCT salary, departmentId in Employee
- Employee Join with CTE to take all salary has rank <= 3
- LEFT JOIN with Department to match name department for each id

- NOTE: If you use WHERE salary IN () instead of JOIN, you may get extra records. For example, with the same salary in this department, it is ranked 3, but with the same salary in another department, it is ranked lower.(I miss that testcase). So if you still want to use WHERE, make sure you use couple of salary and departmentId. But i still recommend use JOIN, Optimize performance in most database management systems, because JOIN takes advantage of optimization mechanisms.
  SELECT name, salary, departmentId
  FROM Employee
  WHERE (salary, departmentId) IN(
  SELECT salary, departmentId
  FROM CTE
  WHERE r_ank <= 3
  )

#### SQL

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT salary, departmentId, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) AS r_ank
    FROM(
        SELECT DISTINCT salary, departmentId
        FROM Employee
    ) AS sub
)
SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee AS e
JOIN CTE
ON e.salary = CTE.salary AND e.departmentId = CTE.departmentId AND CTE.r_ank <= 3
LEFT JOIN Department AS d
ON e.departmentId = d.id
```
