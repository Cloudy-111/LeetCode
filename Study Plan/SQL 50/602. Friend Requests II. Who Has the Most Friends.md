# [602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-requests-ii-who-has-the-most-friends/)

## Description

<p>Table: <code>RequestAccepted</code></p>

<pre>
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
</pre>

Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.

The result format is in the following example.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input: 
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
+----+-----+
Explanation: 
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
</pre>

Follow up: In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?

### Solutions:

- Use CTE accept for accepter_id and number of friend before currentdate
- Use CTE req for request_id and number of friend before currentdate
- Calculate the sum of the number of friends of 2 duplicate ids from 2 CTEs by LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN, UNION to find the MAXIMUM number of friends

- Shorten solutions: Use UNION ALL the accepter_id and requester_id, COUNT them and take MAX

#### SQL:

```sql
WITH accept AS(
    SELECT accepter_id AS id, COUNT(accepter_id) AS num
    FROM RequestAccepted
    WHERE accept_date <= CURDATE()
    Group BY accepter_id
),
req AS(
    SELECT requester_id AS id, COUNT(requester_id) AS num
    FROM RequestAccepted
    WHERE accept_date <= CURDATE()
    Group BY requester_id
)
SELECT id, num
FROM(
    SELECT
        COALESCE(accept.id, req.id) AS id,
        COALESCE(accept.num, 0) + COALESCE(req.num, 0) AS num
    FROM accept
    LEFT JOIN req
    ON accept.id = req.id

    UNION

    SELECT
        COALESCE(req.id, accept.id) AS id,
        COALESCE(req.num, 0) + COALESCE(accept.num, 0) AS num
    FROM req
    LEFT JOIN accept
    ON accept.id = req.id
) AS total
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1
```

```sql
WITH id_CTE AS(
    SELECT accepter_id AS id
    FROM RequestAccepted
    WHERE accept_date <= CURDATE()

    UNION ALL

    SELECT requester_id
    FROM RequestAccepted
    WHERE accept_date <= CURDATE()
)
SELECT id, COUNT(id) AS num
FROM id_CTE
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC
LIMIT 1
```
