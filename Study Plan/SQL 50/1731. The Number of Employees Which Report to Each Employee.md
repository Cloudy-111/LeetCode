# [1731. The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-employees-which-report-to-each-employee/)

## Description

<p>Table: <code>Employees</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int |
| name | varchar |
| reports_to | int |
| age | int |
+-------------+----------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null).
</pre>

For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.

<pre>
Example 1:

Input:
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| employee_id | name | reports_to | age |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| 9 | Hercy | null | 43 |
| 6 | Alice | 9 | 41 |
| 4 | Bob | 9 | 36 |
| 2 | Winston | null | 37 |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
Output:
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| employee_id | name | reports_count | average_age |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| 9 | Hercy | 2 | 39 |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
Explanation: Hercy has 2 people report directly to him, Alice and Bob. Their average age is (41+36)/2 = 38.5, which is 39 after rounding it to the nearest integer.
Example 2:

Input:
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| employee_id | name | reports_to | age |
|-------------|---------|------------|-----|
| 1 | Michael | null | 45 |
| 2 | Alice | 1 | 38 |
| 3 | Bob | 1 | 42 |
| 4 | Charlie | 2 | 34 |
| 5 | David | 2 | 40 |
| 6 | Eve | 3 | 37 |
| 7 | Frank | null | 50 |
| 8 | Grace | null | 48 |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
Output:
+-------------+---------+---------------+-------------+
| employee_id | name | reports_count | average_age |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Michael | 2 | 40 |
| 2 | Alice | 2 | 37 |
| 3 | Bob | 1 | 37 |
+-------------+---------+---------------+-------------+

### Solutions:

- Đếm số lượng trong reports_to mà khác null, nhóm theo reports_to, đếm số lượng employee_id trong mỗi nhóm, tính tuối trung bình
- Đối với lấy tên trong bảng thì có thể làm JOIN chính bảng đó tại e.reports_to = N.employee_id
- Hoặc không cần dùng JOIN, sử dụng bảng con để lấy tên theo reports_to

#### SQL:

```sql
SELECT e.reports_to as employee_id,
        N.name,
        COUNT(e.employee_id) as reports_count,
        ROUND(AVG(e.age), 0) as average_age
FROM Employees as e
JOIN Employees AS N
ON e.reports_to = N.employee_id
WHERE e.reports_to is not null
GROUP BY e.reports_to
ORDER BY e.reports_to
```

```sql
SELECT e.reports_to as employee_id,
        (SELECT M.name FROM Employees AS M WHERE M.employee_id = e.reports_to) as name,
        COUNT(e.employee_id) as reports_count,
        ROUND(AVG(e.age), 0) as average_age
FROM Employees as e
WHERE e.reports_to is not null
GROUP BY e.reports_to
ORDER BY reports_to
```
